# Notebooks

Welcome to the band ratios project notebooks!

This set of notebooks step through the project, including introducing band ratios and spectral measures, and stepping through the simulations and data analyses across this project that explore how band ratio measures relate to spectral features. All figures that are included in the paper are generated or displayed through these notebooks.

### 0-Literature Search

This notebook does an automated literature search of band ratio terms and associations, to map out how band ratio measures are used in the literature.

### 1-BandRatios-Introduction

This notebook introduces band ratios and how to calculate them, as well as introducing the FOOOF model.

### 2-BandRatios-Conflation

This notebook simulates power spectra to demonstrate how changing spectral features could yield the same ratio measure.

### 3-Simulation-Generation

This notebook walks through how spectra were simulated, and example simulated spectra. Simulations include single parameter variations and interacting parameter variations.

### 4-Simulation-Analysis

This notebook calculates ratios measures on the previously generated simulated data, and plots the results.

### 5-EEGDataset-Analysis

This notebook analyzes an EEG dataset to explore relationships between spectral features and band ratios measures.

### 6-EEGDataset-Topographies

This notebook creates topographies for spectral features and ratio measures.

### A1-SpectralRotations

This notebook we explore the effects on band ratios when we rotate power spectra.

### A2-EEGDataDetails

This notebook steps through the details of the EEG dataset that is used, noting dataset descriptions and subject inclusion properties.
