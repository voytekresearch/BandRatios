# Notebooks

Welcome to the band ratios project notebooks!

These notebooks step through the project, including introducing band ratio and spectral measures, and stepping through the simulations and data analyses across this project. Throughout, this project explores how band ratio measures relate to spectral features. All figures that are included in the paper are generated or displayed in these notebooks.

### 0-Introduction

This notebook introduces band ratios and how to calculate them, as well as introducing spectral measures from parameterizing neural power spectra.

### 1-LiteratureSearch

This notebook does an automated literature search of band ratio terms and associations, to map out how band ratio measures are used in the literature.

### 2-Conflations

This notebook simulates power spectra to demonstrate how changing multiple different spectral features can yield the same ratio measures.

### 3-Sims-Generation

This notebook steps through how spectra were simulated, and introduces example simulated spectra.

### 4-Sims-Analysis

This notebook calculates ratios measures on the previously generated simulated data, and plots the results.

### 5-EEG-Analysis

This notebook analyzes EEG data to explore how band ratio measures related to different spectral features in real data.

### 6-EEG-Topographies

This notebook explores how measures vary across EEG channels, creating topographies for spectral features and ratio measures.

### 7-EEG-Blocks

This notebook explores measures across blocks, investigating how changes in band ratio measures relate to changes in other spectral features.

### A1-SpectralRotations

This appendix notebook explores the how band ratio measures relate to rotations of power spectra across different frequencies.

### A2-EEGDataChecks

This appendix notebook explores the EEG dataset that is used, noting dataset descriptions and subject inclusion properties.
